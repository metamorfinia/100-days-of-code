## Log

## Day 0: February 01, 2024.

**Today's Progress:** Started "De basis van JavaScript" on collow.nl. Continued doing Python and started JavaScript exercises on Exercism. Continued Git & GitHub course on Udemy. Started a GitHub collection on Microsoft Learn.

ðŸŽ‰ Joined this challenge!

**Thoughts:** Still extremely overwhelmed with the pletora of available ressources. Don't have a clear plan.
